// Use this file to overwrite the basic Bootstrap variables and add your own variables
// To overwrite a Bootstrap variable you donÂ´t have to touch the Bootstrap folder.
// Just copy a variable from src/sass/assets/bootstrap5/_variables.scss, paste it here and edit the value.


$blue: #04A9FB; // Thats a sample how you could change a BootStrap variable.
$primary: #04A9FB;  // Once we've changed the value, we'll also make it the primary brand color.
